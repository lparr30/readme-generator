  ## Description
  
  I built this project as a way to learn more about Node and how to implement JavaScript into node. This project was also a way to use inquirer, creatign files via the terminal, and using template literals to create .md or .html files as needed. This was a useful project in learning about the code necessary to complete it, but also in the fact that it will save me time in future projects.
